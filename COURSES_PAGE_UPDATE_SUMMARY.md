  isTeacher?: boolean;
}
```

## Technical Improvements

### State Management
```typescript
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [filterCategory, setFilterCategory] = useState('all');
const [filterStatus, setFilterStatus] = useState('all'); // Students only
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'grid' | 'list'>('grid');
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('title');
```

### Computed Statistics
```typescript
const stats = {
  total: courses.length,
  active: courses.filter(c => c.progress < 100).length,
  completed: courses.filter(c => c.progress === 100).length,
  totalStudents: courses.reduce((sum, c) => sum + (c.students || 0), 0)
};
```

### Advanced Filtering
```typescript
const filteredCourses = courses
  .filter(course => 
    course.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    course.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  )
  .filter(course => filterCategory === 'all' || course.category === filterCategory)
  .filter(course => {
    if (filterStatus === 'all') return true;
    if (filterStatus === 'active') return course.progress < 100;
    if (filterStatus === 'completed') return course.progress === 100;
    return true;
  })
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Dynamic sorting based on selected option
  });
```

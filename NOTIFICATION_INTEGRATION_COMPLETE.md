  link: string (optional),      // URL to navigate to
  read: boolean,                // Read status
  created_at: datetime,         // When created
  read_at: datetime (optional)  // When marked as read
}
```

### For Developers

#### Create a Notification
```python
from routes.notifications import create_notification

create_notification(
    db=current_app.db,
    user_id='user_id_here',
    title='Notification Title',
    message='Detailed message here',
    notification_type='success',  # info, success, warning, error
    link='/path/to/relevant/page'  # optional
)
```

#### Example: Quiz Completion
```python
# In backend/routes/quizzes.py
from routes.notifications import create_notification

# After quiz submission
score_percentage = (score / total_points) * 100
notification_type = 'success' if score_percentage >= 70 else 'warning'

create_notification(
    db=db,
    user_id=student_id,
    title='Quiz Completed',
    message=f'You scored {score}/{total_points} ({score_percentage:.1f}%) on "{quiz_title}"',
    notification_type=notification_type,
    link=f'/quizzes/detail?id={quiz_id}'
)
```

#### Example: New Assignment Posted
```python
# In backend/routes/assignments.py
from routes.notifications import create_notification

# After creating assignment
# Notify all enrolled students
enrollments = db.enrollments.find({'course_id': course_id})
for enrollment in enrollments:
    create_notification(
        db=db,
        user_id=enrollment['student_id'],
        title='New Assignment Posted',
        message=f'New assignment "{assignment_title}" in {course_title}. Due: {due_date}',
        notification_type='info',
        link=f'/assignments/detail?id={assignment_id}'
    )
```

.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Created:', data);
  setTimeout(() => window.location.reload(), 1000);

# Comprehensive Course Progress Tracking - Update

## What Was Updated

Enhanced the course progress calculation to include **all course components** with weighted calculations:

### Components Tracked
1. **Materials** (30% weight) - PDFs, readings, links
2. **Videos** (30% weight) - Video lectures with watch time tracking
3. **Assignments** (25% weight) - Homework and projects
4. **Quizzes** (15% weight) - Tests and assessments

## Key Features

### 1. Weighted Progress Formula
```
Overall = (MaterialsÃ—30%) + (VideosÃ—30%) + (AssignmentsÃ—25%) + (QuizzesÃ—15%)
```

### 2. Smart Video Completion
Videos count as complete if:
- Marked complete manually, OR
- Watched â‰¥80% (from watch_time tracking)

### 3. Dynamic Weight Normalization
If a course lacks certain components, weights auto-adjust.

## UI Enhancements

### Course Header
- Overall progress bar with percentage
- Mini cards showing completion counts for each component
- Color-coded icons

### Overview Tab
- 4 stat cards: Overall, Materials, Videos, Assignments
- Detailed progress breakdown section
- Individual progress bars for each component

### Progress Breakdown Section
- Color-coded progress bars:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue - Materials
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple - Videos  
  - ðŸŸ  Orange - Assignments
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green - Quizzes
- Shows count and percentage for each

## Example Calculation

```
Course with:
- Materials: 8/10 (80%)
- Videos: 6/10 (60%)
- Assignments: 3/5 (60%)
- Quizzes: 2/3 (67%)

Overall = (80Ã—0.3) + (60Ã—0.3) + (60Ã—0.25) + (67Ã—0.15)
        = 24 + 18 + 15 + 10
        = 67%
```

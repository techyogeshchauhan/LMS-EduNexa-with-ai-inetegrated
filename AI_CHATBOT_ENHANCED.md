## 📊 How It Works

### Backend Flow:
1. Student sends message with chat type
2. System gathers user context (courses, performance, weak areas)
3. Routes to appropriate AI function based on type
4. Gemini AI generates specialized response
5. Response saved to chat history
6. Returns formatted markdown response

### Frontend Flow:
1. Student selects chat mode
2. Types message or uses quick action
3. Message sent to backend with mode
4. Shows typing indicator
5. Receives and renders markdown response
6. Auto-scrolls to new message
7. Saves to local chat history

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Explain a Topic
```
Mode: Explain Topic
Input: "Explain machine learning"

AI Response:
## 📚 Understanding Machine Learning

### 🎯 Definition:
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence...

### 💡 Simple Analogy:
Think of it like teaching a child to recognize animals...

### 🌍 Real-World Applications:
- Email spam filters
- Recommendation systems
- Self-driving cars

### 📝 Study Tips:
1. Start with supervised learning basics
2. Practice with simple datasets
3. Understand the math behind algorithms
```

### Example 2: Summarize Content
```
Mode: Summarize
Input: "[Long text about data structures]"

AI Response:
## 📝 Summary

### Key Points:
- Arrays store elements in contiguous memory
- Linked lists use pointers for dynamic sizing
- Trees organize data hierarchically

### Important Takeaways:
Choose the right data structure based on your use case

### Study Tips:
Practice implementing each structure in code
```

### Example 3: Quiz Help
```
Mode: Quiz Help
Input: "What sorting algorithm has O(n log n) complexity?"

AI Response:
## 🎯 Quiz Help

### 📚 Approach This Question:
1. Think about common sorting algorithms
2. Review their time complexities
3. Consider which ones are most efficient

### 💡 Hint:
Think about divide-and-conquer algorithms

### 🚀 You've Got This!
Review your notes on sorting algorithms and their complexities
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

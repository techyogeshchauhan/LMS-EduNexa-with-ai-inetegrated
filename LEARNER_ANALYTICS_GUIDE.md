# Learner Analytics - Slow and Fast Learner Detection

This document explains the learner analytics functionality that helps teachers and super admins identify slow learners and fast learners in the EduNexa LMS.

## Overview

The learner analytics system automatically analyzes student performance data to:
- **Identify slow learners** who need additional support
- **Identify fast learners** who could benefit from advanced challenges
- **Generate real-time alerts** for performance issues
- **Provide personalized recommendations** for each student
- **Track learning patterns** and engagement metrics

## Backend Features

### 1. Performance Analysis Algorithm

The system calculates a comprehensive performance score (0-100) based on:
- **Quiz Performance (40% weight)**: Average quiz scores
- **Assignment Performance (40% weight)**: Average assignment grades
- **Course Progress (20% weight)**: Completion percentage

### 2. Learning Pace Detection

Students are classified into three categories:
- **Fast Learners**: >2% progress per day + >6 submissions per month
- **Slow Learners**: <0.5% progress per day or <3 submissions per month
- **Normal Learners**: Between fast and slow thresholds

### 3. Risk Assessment

Students are categorized by risk level:
- **High Risk**: Performance score < 50% or slow learning pace
- **Medium Risk**: Performance score < 70%
- **Low Risk**: Performance score â‰¥ 70%

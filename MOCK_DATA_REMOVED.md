# ✅ Mock Data Removed - Clean Project

## What Was Removed:

### 1. LMSContext.tsx ✅
- ❌ Removed: 3 mock courses
- ❌ Removed: 3 mock assignments  
- ❌ Removed: 3 mock announcements
- ✅ Now: Fetches real data from backend

### 2. CourseDetailPage.tsx ✅
- ❌ Removed: Mock course data
- ❌ Removed: 3 mock modules
- ❌ Removed: 2 mock assignments
- ✅ Now: Shows placeholder until real course selected

### 3. What Remains:
- ✅ User authentication (login/register)
- ✅ Teacher accounts
- ✅ Student accounts
- ✅ Admin accounts
- ✅ Real data from backend

---

## Current State:

### Empty State (No Mock Data):
```
- Courses: Empty until teacher creates
- Assignments: Empty until teacher adds
- Announcements: Empty until admin posts
- Modules: Empty until added to course
```

### Real Data Flow:
```
1. Teacher creates course → Saved to MongoDB
2. Teacher uploads video → Saved to backend
3. Teacher adds modules → Saved to course
4. Student enrolls → Real enrollment
5. Student watches → Real progress tracking
```

---

## How It Works Now:

### For Teachers:
```
1. Login ✅
2. Create Course → Saves to DB
3. Upload Videos → Saves to storage
4. Add Modules → Saves to course
5. View in "My Courses" → Real data
```

### For Students:
```
1. Login ✅
2. View Courses → Real courses from DB
3. Enroll → Real enrollment
4. Watch Videos → Real streaming
5. Track Progress → Real progress
```

---

## Testing:

### Fresh Start:
```
1. Login as teacher
2. "My Courses" will be empty
3. Create a course
4. Upload videos
5. Course appears in list
6. Login as student
7. Enroll in course
8. Course appears in student's list
```

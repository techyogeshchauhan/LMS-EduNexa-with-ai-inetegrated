3. WHEN an assignment is graded THEN the system SHALL record grades and feedback
4. WHEN assignment deadlines approach THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications
5. IF an assignment is submitted late THEN the system SHALL flag it and apply late penalties if configured
6. WHEN assignment analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide completion and grade statistics

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Learning Assistant

**User Story:** As a student, I want to interact with an AI assistant that provides personalized learning recommendations and answers questions, so that I can get immediate help and guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student asks a question THEN the AI assistant SHALL provide contextual responses based on course content
2. WHEN learning patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate personalized course recommendations
3. WHEN a student struggles with concepts THEN the AI SHALL suggest additional resources and practice materials
4. WHEN study plans are requested THEN the AI SHALL create personalized schedules based on goals and availability
5. IF a student shows learning gaps THEN the AI SHALL recommend remedial content
6. WHEN AI interactions occur THEN the system SHALL log conversations for improvement and analytics

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a student/instructor/admin, I want to view detailed progress analytics and performance metrics, so that I can track learning outcomes and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide role-appropriate dashboards and reports
3. WHEN performance trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify at-risk students
4. WHEN course effectiveness is measured THEN the system SHALL provide instructor insights
5. IF learning objectives are not met THEN the system SHALL suggest interventions
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats

### Requirement 6: Discussion and Communication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to participate in course discussions and receive notifications, so that I can engage with the learning community and stay informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a discussion is created THEN the system SHALL organize threads by course and topic
2. WHEN users post messages THEN the system SHALL support rich text formatting and file attachments
3. WHEN important announcements are made THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant users
4. WHEN discussions are moderated THEN instructors SHALL have administrative controls
5. IF inappropriate content is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for review
6. WHEN users are mentioned THEN the system SHALL send targeted notifications

### Requirement 7: File Management and Storage

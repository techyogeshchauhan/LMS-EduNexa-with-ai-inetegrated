# Video Progress & Statistics Features

## Overview
Added comprehensive video progress tracking for students and detailed video statistics for teachers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Student Video Progress Tracking

#### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/progress.py`)

**Enhanced Progress Calculation**
- Course progress now considers video watch time, not just completion status
- Videos watched >80% are automatically marked as complete
- Progress calculation uses weighted formula:
  - Video materials: Based on actual watch percentage
  - Other materials: Based on completion status
  - Formula: `(avg_video_progress * video_weight) + (completed_materials * other_weight)`

**Watch Time Tracking**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/progress/video/<video_id>/watch-time`
- Tracks:
  - Current watch time (seconds)
  - Total video duration (seconds)
  - Progress percentage
  - Last watched timestamp
- Auto-completes material when 80% watched

**Data Stored in `watch_progress` Collection**
```json
{
  "student_id": "user_id",
  "material_id": "video_id",
  "course_id": "course_id",
  "watch_time": 450,
  "total_duration": 600,
  "progress_percentage": 75.0,
  "last_watched": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Teacher Video Statistics

#### New Backend Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/progress/course/<course_id>/videos`
- **Access**: Teachers only (must own the course)
- **Returns**:
  - List of all videos in the course
  - Per-video statistics:
    - Total views
    - Total watch time (formatted)
    - Average completion percentage
    - View rate (% of enrolled students who viewed)
  - Course-level statistics:
    - Total videos
    - Enrolled students count

#### New Frontend Component (`CourseVideosView.tsx`)

**Features**:
- Summary cards showing:
  - Total videos in course
  - Total enrolled students
  - Average completion across all videos
  
- Detailed video cards with:
  - Video title and description
  - Upload date and file size
  - Statistics grid:
    - Total views
    - Total watch time
    - Average completion percentage
    - View rate
  - Visual progress bar showing average student progress
  - Action buttons (Play, Download)

**Access**:
- Added "Video Stats" button in CourseDetailPage header (teachers only)
- Clicking opens full-screen video statistics view
- Back button returns to course detail view

### 3. Course Creation Enhancement

#### Backend (`backend/routes/courses.py`)
- When creating a course, modules/lessons are now properly saved as materials
- Video IDs from uploaded videos are stored in the `content` field
- Each lesson becomes a material entry in the database

**Material Structure**:
```json
{
  "course_id": "course_id",
  "title": "Lesson Title",
  "description": "Lesson description",
  "type": "video",
  "content": "video_id",
  "order": 0,
  "is_required": false,
  "uploaded_by": "teacher_id",
  "created_at": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## How It Works

### For Students:
1. **Watch Videos**: As students watch videos, progress is tracked every 10 seconds
2. **Auto-Complete**: Videos watched >80% are automatically marked complete
3. **Course Progress**: Overall course progress reflects actual video watch time
4. **Resume Watching**: Students can resume videos from where they left off

### For Teachers:
1. **Create Course**: Upload videos as part of course modules
2. **View Statistics**: Click "Video Stats" button in course detail page
3. **Monitor Engagement**: See which videos students are watching
4. **Track Completion**: View average completion rates per video
5. **Identify Issues**: Low completion rates may indicate problematic content

## API Endpoints Summary

### Student Endpoints
- `GET /api/progress/course/<course_id>` - Get course progress with video watch data
- `POST /api/progress/video/<video_id>/watch-time` - Update video watch progress
- `POST /api/progress/material/<material_id>/complete` - Mark material complete

### Teacher Endpoints
- `GET /api/progress/course/<course_id>/videos` - Get video statistics for course

## Database Collections Used

1. **watch_progress** - Stores individual student video watch data
2. **materials** - Stores course materials (videos, PDFs, etc.)
3. **enrollments** - Tracks student enrollment and completion status
4. **videos** - Stores uploaded video file information

## Benefits

### For Students:
- Accurate progress tracking based on actual learning
- Automatic completion when videos are mostly watched
- Better learning experience with resume functionality

### For Teachers:
- Detailed insights into student engagement
- Identify which videos need improvement
- Track overall course effectiveness
- Data-driven course optimization

## Future Enhancements (Suggestions)

1. **Student-level Analytics**: Show individual student watch patterns
2. **Heatmaps**: Visualize which parts of videos students rewatch
3. **Engagement Alerts**: Notify teachers when completion rates drop
4. **Comparative Analytics**: Compare video performance across courses
5. **Export Reports**: Download video statistics as CSV/PDF
6. **Video Recommendations**: Suggest videos based on watch patterns
